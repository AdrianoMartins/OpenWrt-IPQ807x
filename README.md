## Issues
#### Disclaimer: The following known issues are all personal measurements, and there may be unknown issues. I am not responsible for any issues caused by the firmware

* (update)The problem of luci stuck due to memory seems to be fixed (I haven't seen luci crash for several days after booting), but due to at least 5.15 kernel, it can't open 160Mhz.
